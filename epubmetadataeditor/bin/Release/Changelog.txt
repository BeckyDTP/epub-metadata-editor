1.7.4
[*] Added a history to the File Renamer dialog. The program will now remember the last 6 renaming schemes, accessible using a combobox. (If SHIFT is pressed when the "Rename File" link is pressed, the most recent scheme will be used.)
[*] Fixed a problem with zipstorer failing to open some EPUBs because there was data trailing what should be the final comment. (The work-around doesn't seem to result in any data failing to be loaded. And when EPUB Metadata Editor saves changes the resulting zip file is error-free.)
[*] Added a new error message when issue is encountered during the unzipping phase.
[*] Updated EPubMetadataEditorConsole instructions. (The use of "<" and ">" was misleading.)
