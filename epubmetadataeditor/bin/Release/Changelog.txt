1.5.0
[*] Changed "Find EPUB3" button into a more general "Find in current folder..." button that opens a dialog with options to find 1) EPUB3 files, 2) OPF files with tag errors (and the option to fix those errors if found), or 3) OPF files containing a user-defined string.  Any files found will then be listed in the batch file list.  Clicking on an entry in the list will open those files in the main window.
[*] Bug fixes.

Note: the reason for looking for tag errors is that it appears that EPUB Metadata Editor has at some point in the past and possibly for quite a few versions made changes to the OPF file that left it with ">>" when adding or possibly replacing a cover image.  A more recent version introduced "<<" as well!  Most EPUB readers cannot handle these sorts of errors in an XML file.  So using the new "Find in current folder" dialog, you can search a single folder for any EPUBs with these sorts of errors and fix them.

Note, too: it may not be too difficult to extend the searching capabilities so that the entire contents of all the EPUB files in the current folder could be searched for a user-defined string.  I am not sure if this is something people would like to be able to do.  For a large number of EPUB files, this would take a very long time to perform.
